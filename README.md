# **my favorite foods to make**
baking and cooking have been hobbies of mine for as long as i have been allowed to be near the stove (my mom always thought i would burn the house down). over the years there are some definite favorites that i like to make the most.

## baking

### _chocolate chip cookies!_
this was one of the first things i learned how to bake completely from scratch. i really enjoy making these because 1, they're good, and 2, they're easy to share with friends an family.

### _brownies_
although i have not baked brownies from scratch yet, they are another of my favorites for similar reasons to the chocolate chip cookies; they're delicious and easy to share with those i care about.

### _bread_ 
i started baking bread when i was in elementary school for a project where we had to try something new and make a presentation on it. my first attempt did not go well, because when the dough was rising, it was too cold, so most of the yeast died. in the end, my mom just used the bread maker we have at home, but baking bread reminds me of these memories.

### _tteokbokki_
tteokbokki is a popular korean dish and it was one of my favorite foods growing up. because i constantly wanted it, i asked my mom to teach me how to make it. it was a much more simple dish than i thought, and i ended up making it very often. ive stopped making it as often, but it is still a dish i occasionally enjoy making.
