# my favorite foods to make
## baking

### _chocolate chip cookies!_
this was one of the first things i learned how to bake completely from scratch. i really enjoy making these because 1, they're good, and 2, they're easy to share with friends an family.

### _brownies_
although i have not baked brownies from scratch yet, they are another of my favorites for similar reasons to the chocolate chip cookies; they're delicious and easy to share with those i care about.

### _bread_ 
i started baking bread when i was in elementary school for a project where we had to try something new and make a presentation on it. my first attempt did not go well, because when the dough was rising, it was too cold, so most of the yeast died.
